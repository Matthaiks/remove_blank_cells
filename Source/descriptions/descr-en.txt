Quickly remove empty rows and columns from Calc sheets.

After installing the extensions, three entries will be added to the Data menu in LibreOffice Calc:
- Remove blank cells (this opens the main dialog)
- Remove blank rows (without opening the dialog)
- Remove blank columns (without opening the dialog)

There are three shortcuts to call this extension:
- Alt + Shift + B: Open the main dialog
- Alt + Shift + N: Remove blank rows (without opening the dialog)
- Alt + Shift + M: Remove blank columns (without opening the dialog)
